    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the backbone of web development. HTML provides the structure of a webpage—defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images—while CSS controls the visual presentation, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. Together, they allow developers to build visually appealing and well-organized websites</p>
